# codexai portable

Run `run_portable.bat` from this folder. It will create a local `.venv` here and start Streamlit.

This portable copy includes:
- Vision analysis
- Vector QA + ML anomaly detection
- Hackathon single-error section (self-intersection)

You can move this folder anywhere on the same machine (Python 3.13 required).
